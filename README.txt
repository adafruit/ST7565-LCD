Library and example code for using the ST7565 LCD, a 64x128 pixel
serial-controlled LCD array. Forked from https://github.com/adafruit/ST7565-LCD.

git://github.com/pramasoul/ST7565-LCD.git

Pre-fork README said:
There are two 'versions' of the LCD library - one is straightup avr-gcc and the other is an Arduino Library. They're essentially the same.

You can create new icons for bitmapdisplaying using bmp2glcd
