# ST7565-LCD

This fork of the Adafruit ST7565-LCD library includes the changes required to run the library on an Intel Galileo using Windows. It also includes changes to enable you to choose either HW or SW SPI (using spi.h).

=== Original Readme ===
There are two 'versions' of the LCD library - one is straightup avr-gcc and the other is an Arduino Library. They're essentially the same.

You can create new icons for bitmapdisplaying using bmp2glcd
